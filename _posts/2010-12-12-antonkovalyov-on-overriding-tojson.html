summary:
   <p>Last week, we quietly1 rolled out an update that swapped our intramural library for cross-domain communications with easyXDM. We decided in favor of easyXDM simply because it is very well tested and supports more browsers (Firefox 1 anyone?) than the one we built.   The integration process was not that straightforward because embedded Disqus runs in a myriad of different environments; and you will be surprised by how much built-in stuff people tend to override or define carelessly.

<p>Last week, we quietly<a href="#fn1">1</a> rolled out an update that swapped our intramural library for cross-domain communications with <a href="http://easyxdm.net/">easyXDM</a>. We decided in favor of easyXDM simply because it is very well tested and supports more browsers (Firefox 1 anyone?) than the one we built.</p>
<p>The integration process was not that straightforward because embedded Disqus runs in a myriad of different environments; and you will be surprised by how much built-in stuff people tend to override or define carelessly. And <code>Object.toJSON</code> method is just one example.</p>
<p>ECMA-262 defines <code>toJSON</code> as a method that, if exists and callable, returns a value that <code>JSON.stringify</code> can use to convert an object into a JSON text. It is useful, for example, when converting a <code>Date</code> object.</p>
<p>That brings us to Prototype, a library that uses <code>toJSON</code> to convert objects into JSON. There is nothing wrong with this approach except that you can’t use built-in JSON functions (or even Crockford’s JSON2.js), if Prototype is around. Stringifier calls toJSON, gets back a JSON text and converts it into JSON again, adding extra quotes in the result. And we, developers of the embedded widgets, get an environment where <code>JSON.parse(JSON.stringify([1,2,3]));</code> returns a string instead of an array.</p>
<p>To get around this, I used a trick learned from reading easyXDM source:</p>
<pre><code>var obj = {
    a: [1, 2, 3]
}, json = "{\"a\":[1,2,3]}", JSON;

// First, check if JSON object is present and works correctly.

if (JSON &amp;&amp; typeof JSON.stringify === "function" &amp;&amp;
    JSON.stringify(obj).replace((/\s/g), "") === json) {
    DISQUS.json = JSON;
}

// If there is a Prototype on the page, check if we can use Object.toJSON
// and String.evalJSON to stringify and parse objects respectively.

if (Object.toJSON) {
    if (Object.toJSON(obj).replace((/\s/g), "") === json) {
        DISQUS.json.stringify = Object.toJSON;
    }
}

if (typeof String.prototype.evalJSON === "function") {
    obj = json.evalJSON();
    if (obj.a &amp;&amp; obj.a.length === 3 &amp;&amp; obj.a[2] === 3) {
        // This is a working parse method.
        DISQUS.json.parse = function(str){
            return str.evalJSON();
        };
    }
}

// If we cannot use both JSON and Prototype, use our fork of JSON2.js.

if (!DISQUS.json.stringify || !DISQUS.json.parse) {
  // Use JSON2.js
}
</code></pre>
<p>The code works fine until it hits the page where developers thought it was a good idea to make <code>Array.toJSON</code> act as a shortcut to <code>JSON.stringify</code>, or to corrupt <code>toJSON</code> method in some other way<a href="#fn2">2</a>. That matters because JSON2.js follows the specification and tries to use <code>toJSON</code> method whenever possible.</p>
<p>For that kind of situations, we have to add additional check to detect when <code>toJSON</code> is corrupted:</p>
<pre><code>var arr = [1,2,3], corrupted;
  
if (typeof arr.toJSON === "function") {
    arr = arr.toJSON();
    corrupted = !(arr &amp;&amp; arr.length == 3 &amp;&amp; arr[2] == 3);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This code tests only arrays but it should be pretty straightforward to test generic objects as well. And if you have any similar stories or interesting tricks, please share.</p>

<p>2 I remember seeing a website that did something like:<br>
</p><pre><code>Array.prototype.toJSON = function () {
    return new JSONConverter();
};
</code></pre>
