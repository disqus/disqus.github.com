<p>Last night I gave a talk on scale at <a href="http://twitter.com/awpug">AWPUG</a>. I'll admit I had no real idea what I was going to talk about until about two days before, so... your milage with these slides may vary. Most things worth discussing in a group are applicable to more than yourself and by definition reusable. Thankfully Disqus has released a lot of code related to problems we've had a scale, so I pointed out a lot of those in my presentation. Aside from apps you should investigate there are a few quick do's and don'ts, but nothing earth shattering.</p>
<p>I included my notes in the slides. If you click through to SlideShare you can download a plain ol' PDF.</p>
